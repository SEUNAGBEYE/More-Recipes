## Branch Naming

Branches being created should have the following format:

`<story type>/<story id>/<3-4 word story description>`

### Example

`chore/111504508/save-the-world`

The story type indicates the context of the branch and should be written in full and with lowercase letters:

* feature
* chore
* bug
* release

The story description is a summary about the purpose of the branch.It is delimited with hyphen (-). For example, travis-ci-setup

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>``<BLANK LINE>`

**Subject line**
`<type>` should be:

* feature
* bug
* chore
* release

`<scope>` should be something specific to the commit change. For example:

* use present tense: "save" not "saved" or "saving"
* not capitalize first letter i.e no "Carry to safety"
* not end with a dot (.)

**Message body (optional)** If a body is to be written, it should:
* written in present tense.
* include reason for change and difference in the previous behaviour

**Message Footer** This should be used for referencing the issues using the following keywords: Start, Delivers, Fixes and Finishes. It should be written as:

`Start #345`

or in a case of multiple issues:

`Finishes #5438233, #5891837, #4988398`
